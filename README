USAGE:
-n <trials>
-city_strength <city_strength>
-city_health <city_health>
-frigate_strength <frigate_strength>
-n_frigates <number of frigates>
-d <defender_strength>

-d may be appended repeatedly to simulate more defenders

Flags:
-quiet_mode - only output results (AVG_FRIGATES_LEFT AVG_TURNS AVG_SUCCESS)
-trial_data - output results per trial (FRIGATES_LEFT TURNS) - does not output final averages



NOTE: This sim assumes that your frigates do nothing but attack the city and success is on a 0 health city
It also applys shots from defenders in the order listed - it is possible that more efficient shooting from your opponent could make you do worse (though probably only slightly).
